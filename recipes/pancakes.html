      <h2>Descriptipm</h2>
        <p>
          A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round,
           prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and 
           cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or 
           butter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most 
          widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.
